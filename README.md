# gatorblocks_rbt
 A reboot version of GatorBlocks built from the ground up.

 This reboot respository features cleaner organization. Widgets in separate folders, rebuilt widgets with proper states, etc.

 If you have cloned the previous repository, please do not delete it as it can be used as a reference.
 Please clone this project to a brand new directory so it does not interfere with previous builds.

 Thank you.
